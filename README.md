# Adam's frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
===============================

Bugs have taken over the streets and you need to get to safety. Bugs hate water, so get across the road - it's your only chance!

Once you reach safety in the water, you will be teleported back to begin the journey again.

just the cursor keys: up/down/left/right


## how to run/play

just open the index.html file in your browser


### udacity notes

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
